# Queue in java

## available methods:
* isEmpty() -> true if the queue is empty
* insert() -> add element to queue
* extract() -> remove and return first element in queue
* revolution() -> reverse the queue

#### everything was coded with this variables and methods it was a STUPID thing to do future employers skip this repo pls :)

## how does it work?
when inserting a new element, there is a random possibility to add it to the initial array, or to add the element in a newly created queue (like a linked list)

ive found out why people dont use randomness when working with queues :(
